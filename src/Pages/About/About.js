							"My love for learning stems from a family that stressed the importance of a good education from the very beginning. Growing up, we lived in student housing while my mom and dad pursued a better life for our family. Around the time I was born, my dad finished up his Master’s from the University of Wisconsin and became a first-class high school teacher. Over the years, I befriended several of his former students who absolutely loved my dad as a teacher. He has an approach both in the classroom and with people in general that is welcoming and understanding, and is an incredibly bright individual. He started off as an English and Math teacher, and then taught himself everything he could about computer networking, focusing mainly on Linux systems. He was able to transition into being a computer science teacher at his high school, which I think he found to be a lot more rewarding. My mom continued to pursue her PhD in Nursing until I was about 10, when she graduated and received a job at one of the top 3 schools of nursing in the country, the University of North Carolina. She now does talks all over the world on a system for monitoring breathing in premature babies while they are feeding. I’ve learned so much about the importance of learning new things and pushing the limits of your current situation from these two individuals, but it took me a while to fully understand how I could do the same.",

							"When I was 10, I was introduced to the great game of golf by my dad, and my life was immediately changed forever. As a kid, I would pour over every instructional book and magazine I could get my hands on and try to implement the tips being provided in these resources. I spent every day after school hitting balls into a net from a mat my dad and grandfather built for us, often hitting more than 500 balls a day. My dad and I spent every Saturday and Sunday out on the links together, forming an unbreakable bond and leaving me with memories that will likely last a lifetime. In 2015 we spent 7 days in Scotland, the home of golf, playing some of the most famous and oldest golf courses you can find anywhere. We played 13 rounds in 7 days, walking every course and soaking in the scenery and history-rich treasures as much as we could. This was a trip of a lifetime; I hope we are able to do it again at some point.",

							"Golf is arguably the most difficult game on the planet to learn, and is never entirely able to be mastered. There’s always something new to work on in your swing to make it better, or a different facet of the game to improve, like chipping, putting, or your sand game. In a lot of ways, it’s just like learning to code. Anyone can pick up a book on JavaScript and learn a thing or two, maybe even create a function, but it takes years of practice to get to level of adequacy in the coding world. There are so many different languages, frameworks, and disciplines you can learn; there’s literally a lifetime’s worth of information to consume and it may not be possible to be a complete master of everything there is to know. For this very reason, I have been drawn into coding. I want something that’s going to challenge me on a daily basis, and something I can continue to learn more about throughout my lifetime. I don’t think it’s that rewarding to learn a skill, master it, and then go through a career implementing that mastery. While it’s nice to master something, wouldn’t it get boring at some point doing something that easy?",

							"I thought I had found this endless challenge in college, when I decided to pursue a degree in Economics. In my first Economics class, I looked around at everyone in the class struggling with these difficult concepts and reveled in the fact that they made sense to me. I kept going, taking some pre-graduate courses in my senior year that really pushed the envelope, one in particular being Econometrics, a blend of Economics, Calculus and Statistics that was as interesting as it was mind-bending. After the first exam, my professor made a slide of what everyone scored on the exam. Most of the scores hovered between 50 and 70, with some outliers below this level. Then, she scowled as she showed there were two students who were able to score in the 80s. I received an 89 on that test, and continued to dominate this course for the remainder of the semester. I still love Economics to this day, but I realized at some point it wasn’t something I was truly passionate about; I was just really good at it.",

							"After college, I decided to join some buddies up in the ski slopes of Colorado for a season to let loose and enjoy the last little bit of freedom I would have before life really set in. Within 2 months, I broke my leg and ended up getting stuck financially up there for 4 years. Don’t get me wrong, I think back on those 4 years with a fondness, but I put my aspirations on hold as I worked as a manager and chef at a delicious barbecue restaurant. I still crave ribs every day. This also led to a relationship with my future fiancé and partner-in-crime. She was in the same boat as I was, working as a server at a lucrative restaurant, but wanting more from life. We made a plan to move to Florida, where I would pursue a career in golf while she would pursue a career as a real estate agent. For the last 4 years, I’ve moved my way up in the golf world, starting out as a golf shop attendant to being an Assistant Golf Professional at one of the most prestigious clubs in the area. I love my job in a lot of ways; I manage a crew of great guys and get to interact with awesome members every day. One of the biggest challenges in this job is creating tournaments and running them from start to finish. There are so many different things that go into running a tournament, from building the scorecards and pairings, to managing the crew, to managing the players, and everything else in between. Beyond this challenge, though, I’ve felt mentally stagnant for some time. Once you have the basics of the job down, there’s really nothing more to learn and the growing stops.",

							"Then, on June 26th, 2018, Kaija Grace was born, our beautiful daughter. She is the light of my life, giving me purpose for everything instead of just going through the motions. Suddenly, a life of mediocrity was not an option for me. I wanted to have an impact on the world and give my daughter someone to look up to. I want her to tell her friends about how awesome her dad is and how proud she is of me. I struggled with whether or not I would continue to pursue a career in golf and just make the best of it, or try something else for the better part of a year. I thought about doing something with my Economics degree, since I loved it so much. After all, data analysis is becoming hugely popular; maybe I could take that degree and couple it with some coding to create a unique and powerful skillset. That’s what sparked my journey.",

							"On May 26th, 2019, I sat down to a course I found on Treehouse teaching mySQL to learn about this interesting database language. It was about a 25 hour course, and I nearly finished it in a week’s time while working full-time. I realized coding was something attainable for me and it fit with the way I thought about the world. I started exploring the ecosystem, trying to find what I would do after this first course. Should I stick with something like mySQL or learn something else? Everything I read online about current opportunities told me to learn HTML, CSS and maybe JavaScript. This would give you the basis to be able to build websites, a seriously valuable skillset. So, I gave it a try. The curriculum I was following had me set up a coding environment, with a Virtual Machine running Unix and vsCode as a text editor. After much trial and error, I got this to work and started writing some code. I followed a short tutorial on HTML and CSS to build a very simple website, launched a live server, and there it was, my first code transcribed on the screen of a web browser. I was blown away and incredibly excited. I wanted so much more, so I started exploring this new world like a mad man.",

							"There were some missteps in the first month or so of my journey, but I finally landed on some great tutorials that opened up so many doors to things I didn’t even know about. I followed a course that went from HTML all the way through NodeJS and MongoDB, giving me a brief glimpse of the full stack, and I knew I would need to know more. I signed up for more and more online courses and built so many projects along the way. Every day, I would get home from work, spend some time with my little one, and then get to work on my endeavors, coding into the early morning hours. I went from going to sleep at 9 PM every night to cutting my sleep time down to about 5 or 6 hours a night. I just can’t seem to get enough. I’ve spent the majority of my time learning JavaScript and using React as a framework for my apps, but there are so many other areas of this vast universe I would like to explore eventually.",
